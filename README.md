# TuneFlow - Music App

## About the Project

This project was developed as an intensive challenge: **building a fully functional native Android application in just 7 days.**

A key aspect of this challenge was that **I learned Kotlin from scratch** during this single week. The goal was to master the language syntax and the Android ecosystem while simultaneously delivering a robust and user-friendly application.

## App Overview

TuneFlow is an Android application developed in Kotlin that allows users to **discover** new music based on their **tastes**. Recommendations are based on the songs the user has **previously liked**.
The app provides personalized suggestions, enables playlist creation and sharing, and allows music discovery based on moods.

The app supports both **light mode** and **dark mode**.
The music suggestion algorithm triggers once the user has liked at least **10 songs**, ensuring the recommendations are based on sufficient data about the user's preferences.

### Key Features:

- Personalized suggestions based on your favorite tracks
- Create and manage playlists
- Share playlists with your friends
- Listen to music tailored to a specific mood
- Search for tracks using the search bar
- Listening history and usage statistics
